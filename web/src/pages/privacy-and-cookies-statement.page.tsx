              advertising tracking features. For more information on this, please see the following links:

              Your personal data or any other information collected will be stored for as long as necessary to fulfil
              the purposes described in this Notice. However, we will also retain data subject to relevant provisions of

              your data for targeted marketing purposes once you unsubscribe from our marketing communications.
              <br />
              <br />
              Please note that your data may be retained for a more extended period, notwithstanding your request to

              <br />
              <strong style={{ marginLeft: '30px' }}>10. How your data is stored</strong> <br />
              We store and process your data?. We protect your data using physical, technical, and administrative
              security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure and alteration.
              Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls, and information
              access authorisation controls.
              <br />
              <br />
              Where there is an actual or suspected data breach capable of causing harm to your rights and freedoms, we
              will notify you without undue delay and use our best effort to remedy the violation within one (1) month

              <br />
              <strong style={{ marginLeft: '30px' }}>11. International transfer of data</strong> <br />
              To achieve the purposes described in this Notice, we may transfer your data to countries that may not
              offer an adequate protection level or are not considered to have sufficient law by the National
              Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA). Where personal data is to be transferred to a country
              outside Nigeria, we shall put adequate measures to ensure data security.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our data transfers to the countries that do not offer an adequate protection level are subject to the
              conditions under the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). We will therefore only transfer Personal
              Data out of Nigeria on one of the following conditions:
              <ul>
                <li>Your consent has been obtained; </li>
                <li>
                  The transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between Us and you or implementation of
                  pre-contractual measures taken at your request;
                </li>
                <li>
                  The transfer is necessary to conclude a contract between Us and the third party in your interest;
                </li>
                <li> The transfer is necessary for reason of public interest; </li>
                <li> The transfer is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; </li>
                <li>
                  The transfer is essential to protect your vital interests or other persons, where the Data Subject is
                  physically or legally incapable of giving consent.
                </li>
              </ul>
